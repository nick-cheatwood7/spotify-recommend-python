# spotify-recommend-python

## Overview
This project explores using a simple dataset, like [this Spotify dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=tracks.csv) to explore metadata of tracks and create recommendations based off said metadata.

## Config
Due to file size limitations by GitHub, I've excluded the `tracks.csv` file from the repo.  After downloading the **Spotify dataset** mentioned above, drag and drop the `tracks.csv` file into the `data` folder.

## Required Packages
Note: Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) for package installs.
- Numpy
  - `pip install numpy`
- Pandas
  - `pip install pandas`
- Matplotlib
  - `pip install matplotlib`
- Seaborn
  - `pip install seaborn`
- Tqdm
  - `pip install tqdm`

## Credits
This project was inspired by [this article](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/03/03/spotify-recommendation-system-with-machine-learning/) on simulating the Spotify recommendation engine in Python.
